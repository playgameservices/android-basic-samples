  <p>Hello, Play Games developers!</p>

    <p>Sometimes, you have a player who has a public leaderboard score
      that you don't want to share---a tester, a cheater, whatever.
      You can do hide that player with the <b>Play Games Management API</b>.</p>

    <p>We've built this tool to make it easy. They will still be able to
      submit high scores, get achievements, and appear on social leaderboards,
      but hidden players will not appear on public leaderboards.</p>

    <h3>Setup</h3>

    <p>To use this tool, you'll need to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Host this page somewhere.  Anywhere will do, including localhost.</li>
      <li>Make a web app entry for your game (read about it
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/games/services/console/enabling#a_create_a_linked_application">here</a>
        (<i>click on the "Web" tab</i>)), even if you aren't
        releasing a web app.</li>
      <li>Enter your <b>application ID</b> and
        <b>any leaderboard ID</b> in <tt>hider.js</tt>,
        and your <b>web client ID</b> in
        (the one you created in the previous step) into the scripts
        within the code on this page!</li>
      <li>Reload this page, and then sign in with an account
        that has developer permissions.  This is either the account
        that owns the game in Developer Console, or a team member
        with owner permission)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Warnings</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Hiding takes around ~100ms to propagate, but you may see
        results slower, especially if you are on mobile and caching.
        Mobile caches may take several hours to refresh.</li>
      <li>Unhiding is very slow, and can take as long as 12 hours.
        Please unhide with caution.</li>
      <li>If you hide someone, you will have no way of retrieving their
        ID again---once hidden, forever lost.  <code><b>Keep a log of people
            you hide</b> in case you change your mind.</code></li>
    </ul>
