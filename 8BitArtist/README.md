===========================================

This is a sample game for Google Play Games services turn-based
multiplayer.  Although it's hardly a complete commercial-level game,
it does show one way to think about game initialization, replay, and
other turn-based features.

Rules: One player draws a word, but the drawing is restricted to 4
colors and 100 pixels.  The other player guesses from a list of words.

To set up, follow the Eclipse directions here:

https://github.com/playgameservices/android-samples

including creating ids.

Be sure to set the ids in res/values/ids.xml. You'll need five
achievements.  You'll also need to turn on turn-based multiplayer when
you link your Android app.

Feel free to ask questions!
